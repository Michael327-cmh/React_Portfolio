# React_Portfolio
This is a snippet of my portfolio using React. 

The CSS is not pulling correctly. The skeleton structure exists but it is not fully fleshed out with the color and character needed to make a full site. 

The links work for a couple of the sections but not all. 

I looked to import my resume and link it in the resume section. The resume is loaded into the file but has not been linked. 

The links for my project are loaded but are not currently set up as links.
